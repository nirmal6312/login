js =>  javascript 
javascript is a scripting/programming language that use for build logics
and to build a dynamic web page .
extension  => .js
we can use two type of js => 
1. internal js
2.external js

internal js =>
internal use in html file with <script> </script> tag.

external js => external js use with it extension .js . when we run a js 
extension file our output show in console / terminal.


1.Varibales => variables is a special charcter or a single word
that use to store the whole value of any content.we can reuse
the varibales .
we can define different values in a varibale=>
1.String value
2.Number value
3.Object
4.Array
5.Boolean
6.Null
7.Undefined
8.Zero  

2.Display posibilities =>
console =>
a.console.log()
b.console.warn()
c.console.error()
d.console.table()

document.write() => for use Display the value in body

popup methods => for use to dynamic value or take a value from user.
a. prompt() => prompt is a js function that allows for take a value from user . 
prompt value store in string . when we should change this data type into number
then we use eval().

* and we should check data type of any varibale then we use typeof()
function.

`` => template literlas => for use to define the statement and a variable 
, function in same line then we use like this `stament  ${js}`. in template
literlas we can use any tag.

operators => operators use for mathematical operations and condition statement

a. airthemetic operators => airthemetic are those special keywords that use for mathematical 
operations.
e.g=> + , - , * , / 

b. assigment operator => assigment operators use for also mathematical
 operations but in these operators we can assign the value with using of 
 +,-,*,/
 += , -= , *= , /=

 c . comparison operator => comparison operator use for compare multiple 
 values.comparison operator check the  value is boolean (true or false)
 or not.
 > , < , >= ,<= , = , == , ===

d.ternary operator => ternary operator also check the boolean true or false
in ternary operator there are three expressions .
e.g => ist?2nd:3rd
in this example ist expressions is check condition . and 2nd expressions
Display the output of statement when condition is true .and 3rd expressions
Display the output of stament when condition is false.

logical operator => to use check the multiple conditions at a time .
logical operator can change condition.
A. && => AND OPERATOR => and operator check the multiple conditon . our 
output show when both condition are true. when only one condition is true
then its all condition false.
 E.G =>
 FALSE && FALSE = FALSE
 FALSE && TRUE= FALSE
 TRUE && FALSE = FALSE
 TRUE && TRUE = TRUE
B. || => OR OPERATOR => or operator show output when only one condition is
 true.
 E.G =>
 FALSE || TRUE = TRUE
 TRUE || FALSE = TRUE
 TRUE || TRUE = TRUE
 FALSE || FALSE = FALSE
 c. ! => NOT OPERATOR => when we should change the condition in true to false, false to true
 then we use ! not operator
 E.G =>
 !TRUE = FALSE
 !FALSE = TRUE

 shorthand operators =>
 increment and decrement operatos => use to increase or decrease a value 
 by 1.
 ++ => increment operator
 -- => decrement operator

 condition statements =>
 if 
 if else
 if else if
 if if if else => nested if else
 =
 if => if show the output of true condition
 else => when condition is false then statemt show of else
